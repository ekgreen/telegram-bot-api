/**
 * Traditional chat bots can of course be taught to understand human language.
 * But sometimes you want some more formal input from the user â€” and this is where custom
 * keyboards can become extremely useful.
 *
 * Whenever your bot sends a message, it can pass along a special keyboard with predefined
 * reply options (see ReplyKeyboardMarkup). Telegram apps that receive the message
 * will display your keyboard to the user. Tapping any of the buttons will immediately
 * send the respective command. This way you can drastically simplify user interaction
 * with your bot.
 *
 * This is marker interface
