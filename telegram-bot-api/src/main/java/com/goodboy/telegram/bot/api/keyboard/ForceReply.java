/**
 * Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will display
 * a reply interface to the user (act as if the user has selected the bot's
 * message and tapped 'Reply'). This can be extremely useful if you want
 * to create user-friendly step-by-step interfaces without having to sacrifice
 * privacy mode.
 *
 * Example: A poll bot for groups runs in privacy mode (only receives commands, replies
 * to its messages and mentions). There could be two ways to create a new poll:
 *
 * 1) Explain the user how to send a command with parameters (e.g. /newpoll question answer1
 * answer2). May be appealing for hardcore users but lacks modern day polish.
 * 2) Guide the user through a step-by-step process. 'Please send me your question',
 * 'Cool, now let's add the first answer option', 'Great. Keep adding answer options,
 * then send /done when you're ready'.
 *
 * The last option is definitely more attractive. And if you use ForceReply in your bot's
 * questions, it will receive the user's answers even if it only receives replies,
 * commands and mentions â€” without any extra work for the user.
